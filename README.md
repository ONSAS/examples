# ONSAS-examples

This repository contains an open collection examples/scripts of problems solved using ONSAS.

By the moment, each script requires that you have an environment variable named: `ONSAS_PATH` defined, including the path to your ONSAS folder, in order to run. 

These scripts are shared under a [public domain license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense).
